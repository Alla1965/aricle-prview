## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

Пользователи должны иметь возможность:

- просматривать оптимальную компоновку компонента в зависимости от размера экрана своего устройства;
- видеть ссылки для публикации в социальных сетях при нажатии на значок «Поделиться».

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

Добавьте скриншот вашего решения. Проще всего это сделать, открыв проект в Firefox, щёлкнув правой кнопкой мыши по странице и выбрав «Сделать скриншот». В зависимости от длины страницы можно выбрать полноэкранный или обрезанный скриншот. Если страница очень длинная, лучше обрезать её.

Кроме того, для создания скриншота можно использовать инструмент, например [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/). FireShot бесплатен, поэтому покупать его не нужно.

Затем обрежьте/оптимизируйте/отредактируйте изображение по своему усмотрению, добавьте его в проект и обновите путь к файлу на изображении выше.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

**Примечание: Удалите это примечание и абзацы выше при добавлении скриншота. Если вы предпочитаете не добавлять скриншот, можете удалить весь этот раздел.**
